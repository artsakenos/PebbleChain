Pebble
======

A block header is a 264 bit string built like this:

    [getMerkel_root()][getCreated_epoch()][getNonce()   ]
    [256bit (64Hex)  ][4bit (1 Long)     ][4bit (1 Long)]

The merkel root should always include:

* hash_previous - To validate the chain
* target - If you need to validate the target
* data - The Block data

E.g., according to the Pebble version 20191105 the merkel data (before hashing)
is shaped like this:

    version + "\n"
    + pebble.getHash_previous() + "\n"
    + pebble.getTarget() + "\n"
    + pebble.getOwner() + "\n"
    + links
    + pebble.getData() + "\n"

Securing Data
=============
If recipient is set:

* Data can be encrypted with recipient public key
* Header can eventually be also encrypted according to some version, so that only recipient can check block validity
* TODO, i'll use SuperBouncyCastle and Base64 encoding.
